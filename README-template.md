## Overview

### Screenshot

![](images/SSQRCodeSite.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process
I put the design together in Figma. Then I put the diferrent elements into fitting HTML tags, and lastly started styling it like the figma design, width under 600px, then for larger. There were no real difference between the mobile and desktop design here, so I just changed the background color, when the width exceeded 600px.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
