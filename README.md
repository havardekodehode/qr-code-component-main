## My process
I put the design together in Figma. Then I put the diferrent elements into fitting HTML tags, and lastly started styling it like the figma design, width under 600px, then for larger. There were no real difference between the mobile and desktop design here, so I just changed the background color, when the width exceeded 600px.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this assignment, I learned how a README.md should look like.
